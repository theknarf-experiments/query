- Write functional and immutable code

- Work with Test Driven Development

- Create commit after implementing new tested features

- Use cargo check and cargo clippy to check code for lint errors

- Use cargo fmt to format code

- Keep a TODO.md with tasks that needs to be done, remove completed tasks from it (the git history tracks whats done, no need to keep it in a file)

- Ensure that you don't commit binary files and build artifacts
